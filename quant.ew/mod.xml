 <!--
     April 1 2021 - a mod declared as game mode (is_game_mode="1") can enable support for multiple save slots via game_mode_supports_save_slots="1"
 -->
<!--
    If a mod requires access to the full lua api e.g. os.* io.* it has to request acesss via 'request_no_api_restrictions="1"'.
    It is recommended that other options are explored first, as we may completely disable those APIs in the future.
    By default mods have access to the table, string, math and bit libraries and to the APIs exposed by the game.
