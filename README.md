## Noita Entangled Worlds - Play Noita not alone

Noita Entangled Worlds is an experimental mod for Noita that aims to make a true coop multiplayer possible.

What is synced as of now:
 - Players, their positions, health, perks and inventories
 - Wand usage
 - Item usage
 - Items in world (One player can throw a wand/potion/spell/item, another can pick it up)
 - Enemies and their attacks
 - Pixels of the grid world
 - Fungal shifts
 - Polymorphing
