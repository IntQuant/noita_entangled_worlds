### Installation MacOs (provided by @Ownezx and @Roenalt)

1. Install a GOG copy of Noita using [portingkit](https://www.portingkit.com/) by following the guide given directly on the Noita entry page on portingkit with a few specific options in the "Advance Settings" step:
   1. Set the Engine to "WS12WineKegworks10.0-battle.net"
   2. Set the Operating System to "Windows 11". 
2. After confirming that the game launch, open the folder where the game is installed and navigate to where the `noita.exe` is located (usually in "/Users/{User}/Applications/Noita.app/Contents/SharedSupport/prefix/drive_c/GOG Games/Noita") and add a shortcut to it in the sidebar of the Finder. 
3. Go to [releases](https://github.com/IntQuant/noita_entangled_worlds/releases), download the latest `noita-proxy-macos.zip`.
4. Unpack it and launch the proxy, it will ask to give the path to the `noita.exe` (that we save a shortcut to!). Once the path is given, the proxy will be able to download and install the mod automatically.
5. Close the proxy, then launch it again via a terminal with the following command: `~/Applications/noita-proxy-macos/noita_proxy --launch-cmd '"/Users/{User}/Applications/Noita.app/Contents/MacOS/wineskinlauncher" --run "C:\GOG Games\Noita\noita.exe"'`
6. Then you can enjoy the mod as usual, by enabling it in the "Mods" menu of Noita.

Note: The proxy must be launched via terminal with the command above every time you want to play multiplayer.

## Connect using Steam

In the Proxy window, click on "Create Lobby". Then, "Save lobby ID to clipboard". Send that ID to your friends, who can then *copy* it and press "Connect to lobby in clipboard".

After that, just start a new Noita game on everyone's PCs, and you should be in multiplayer mode :)

## When to press "New Game" and when to press "Continue"

 - "New Game" - you're joining a multiplayer run you haven't joined before.
 - "Continue" - you're reconnecting to a multiplayer run that you've joined before and hasn't ended yet.

Using the same save file for multiplayer and singleplayer isn't something that should be done.

## Global perks

Some perks are perks and affect the entire world, and thus are shown for every player.

There are 11 global perks:
 - No More Shuffle
 - Unlimited Spells
 - Trick Blood Money
 - Gold is Forever
 - Greed
 - Trick Greed
 - Peace with Gods
 - Extra Item in Holy Mountain
 - More Love
 - More Hatred
 - More Blood
